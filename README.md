### Hi I'm Max!

I am especially interested in how I can use my skill set to make a useful impact. On our society and our future.

I have been passionate about Computer Science for years. I create websites, work with newest technologies such as WebAR, and develop solutions to community problems.

Currently, I study computer science and work for a freelancing creative technologist and online strategist.
